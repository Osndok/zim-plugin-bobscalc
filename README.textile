h2. Features

* ignores everything before the last ":" on a line (e.g. for labels)
* *might* work for a few outline types
* can evaluate an expression by hitting "Ctrl-&#60;Equals&#62;"

e.g. you can type "something: 123*455&#60;Ctrl-Equals&#62;"

*NOTE:* After enabling the plugin, you will probably have to restart
zim to actually use the hotkey, as the "zoom in"/Ctrl-Plus will interfere.
